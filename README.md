Financial institutions face significant challenges in assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants. Accurate evaluation of an applicants ability to repay a loan is crucial for minimising defaults and managing risk.

By leveraging machine learning and predictive analytics, institutions can enhance their loan approval and make more informed decisions.
