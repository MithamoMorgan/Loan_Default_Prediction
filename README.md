## Predicting Loan Default Risk

### Introduction:

Financial institutions face significant challenges in assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants. Accurate evaluation of an applicants ability to repay a loan is crucial for minimising defaults and managing risk. Traditional methods of credit assessment may not fully capture the complexities of individual financial behaviour, leading to potential lossess for lenders. By leveraging machine learning and predictive analytics, institutions can enhance their loan approval and make more informed decisions

### Challenge:

Develop a predictive model that accurately evaluates the risk of loan defaults based on applicant data. The model should assist financial institutions in making better lending decisions, ultimately reducing the risk of defaults and improving overall portfolio performance.

### Objectives:
**1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
  * Analyse the dataset to identify key feaatures that influence loan default risk.
  * Perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the dataset is ready for modelling.

**2. Model Development:**
  * Build and train a predictive model to evaluate the likelihood of loan defaults.
  * Explore and implement various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, etc

**3. Evaluation**
* Assess the model's performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC, and especially the precision-recall trade-off to balance risk and reward.
* Ensure the model's predictions are fair and unbiased, particularly in sensitive areas like income and employment status.

**4. Actionable Insights:**
* Provide insights into the factors that most significantly impact loan default risk.
* Offer Recommendations on how financial institutions can integrate the model into their loan approval processes to enhance decision making and risk management.
